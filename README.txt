PART 4

Hi again, there was another timeline problem: some parts of what I want to tell you have been set in another universe.
I need you to "rebase" this universe with ours. The past messages went to the branch `earth2`

But this branch is not yet synchronised with you and only sits on the remote repository.
So you will need to do something like `git rebase origin/BRANCH_NAME` with the branch that has the past messages
