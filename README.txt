PART 1

Hello there!

We are gonna play a little game of hide and seek: you will look for git mastery and I'll be your guide.

First, congratulations on getting here and let's start this journey of discovery.
You used a command to get this repository that started with `git clone` followed a Github URL.
This URL is composed of several parts: the github.com part followed by two values separated by a `/`.

The first value is the owner of the repository and the second one is the name of the repository.
That allows for different people to use the same repository name.

And with that information, we will start our journey, I want you to go on another branch!
The name of that branch is 'treasure_hunt' 

Good luck!
